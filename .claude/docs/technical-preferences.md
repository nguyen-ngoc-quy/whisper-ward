# Technical Preferences

<!-- Populated by /setup-engine. Updated as the user makes decisions throughout development. -->
<!-- All agents reference this file for project-specific standards and conventions. -->

## Engine & Language

- **Engine**: Unity 6 LTS (6000.3.17f1)
- **Language**: C#
- **Rendering**: URP (Universal Render Pipeline)
- **Physics**: PhysX (Unity default)

## Input & Platform

<!-- Written by /setup-engine. Read by /ux-design, /ux-review, /test-setup, /team-ui, and /dev-story -->
<!-- to scope interaction specs, test helpers, and implementation to the correct input methods. -->

- **Target Platforms**: PC (Windows), Web (WebGL demo for portfolio sharing)
- **Input Methods**: Keyboard/Mouse
- **Primary Input**: Keyboard/Mouse
- **Gamepad Support**: Partial (recommended for PC)
- **Touch Support**: None
- **Platform Notes**: PC is the primary target. WebGL demo is a build target for portfolio sharing — keep draw calls low for browser performance. All UI must support mouse navigation.

## Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `PlayerController`)
- **Variables**: Public fields/properties PascalCase (e.g., `MoveSpeed`); private fields `_camelCase` (e.g., `_moveSpeed`)
- **Signals/Events**: PascalCase + `Event` suffix (e.g., `OnPlayerSpotted`)
- **Files**: PascalCase matching class (e.g., `PlayerController.cs`)
- **Scenes/Prefabs**: PascalCase matching root (e.g., `FacilityLevel.unity`, `GuardNPC.prefab`)
- **Constants**: PascalCase (e.g., `MaxSuspicion`, `DefaultMoveSpeed`)

## Performance Budgets

- **Target Framerate**: 60 fps
- **Frame Budget**: 16.6 ms
- **Draw Calls**: ~1000 (URP, PC); lower for WebGL target
- **Memory Ceiling**: TBD — set during profiling

## Testing

- **Framework**: NUnit (Unity Test Framework) — to be confirmed with user before adding
- **Minimum Coverage**: TBD
- **Required Tests**: Balance formulas, gameplay systems, AI systems (Behavior Tree, Perception)

## Forbidden Patterns

- [None configured yet — add as architectural decisions are made]
- See unity-specialist agent for Unity-specific anti-patterns (e.g., `FindObjectOfType`, `SendMessage`, `Resources.Load`)

## Allowed Libraries / Addons

- [None configured yet — add as dependencies are approved]
- **Approved Unity packages**: URP, Input System (new), Cinemachine, NavMesh, ProBuilder, Unity Test Framework

## Architecture Decisions Log

- [No ADRs yet — use /architecture-decision to create one]

## Engine Specialists

<!-- Written by /setup-engine when engine is configured. -->
<!-- Read by /code-review, /architecture-decision, /architecture-review, and team skills -->
<!-- to know which specialist to spawn for engine-specific validation. -->

- **Primary**: unity-specialist
- **Language/Code Specialist**: unity-specialist (C# review — primary covers it)
- **Shader Specialist**: unity-shader-specialist (Shader Graph, HLSL, URP materials)
- **UI Specialist**: unity-ui-specialist (UI Toolkit UXML/USS, UGUI Canvas, runtime UI)
- **Additional Specialists**: unity-dots-specialist (ECS, Jobs system, Burst compiler), unity-addressables-specialist (asset loading, memory management, content catalogs)
- **Routing Notes**: Invoke primary for architecture and general C# code review. Invoke DOTS specialist for any ECS/Jobs/Burst code. Invoke shader specialist for rendering and visual effects. Invoke UI specialist for all interface implementation. Invoke Addressables specialist for asset management systems.

### File Extension Routing

<!-- Skills use this table to select the right specialist per file type. -->
<!-- If a row says [TO BE CONFIGURED], fall back to Primary for that file type. -->

| File Extension / Type | Specialist to Spawn |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Game code (.cs files) | unity-specialist |
| Shader / material files (.shader, .shadergraph, .mat) | unity-shader-specialist |
| UI / screen files (.uxml, .uss, Canvas prefabs) | unity-ui-specialist |
| Scene / prefab / level files (.unity, .prefab) | unity-specialist |
| Native extension / plugin files (.dll, native plugins) | unity-specialist |
| General architecture review | unity-specialist |
